        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello There!</br></br> I'm currently working as a software tester at Techzarlogy, where I've learned a lot about how software is made and how to solve problems effectively. 
          My interest in software development started at WeThinkCode, where I got into designing and making things work smoothly.</br></br>In my previous internship in web development, I used JavaScript to create a cool and user-friendly website for a client, flexing my creative muscles.</br></br>
          Now, I'm excited about the idea of joining a team that cares a lot about making quality software. 
          I'm not just looking for a job;I want to be part of a group of tech-loving folks who are always pushing for new and better things.
          What really drives me is the chance to make a big impact. </br></br>
          I'm on the lookout for a company that values technology and sees it as a way to move forward. 
          Let's go on this adventure togetherâ€”I'm ready to make a difference and build an awesome career!
